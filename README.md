# AmazonCLI
AmazonCLI (or Bamazon) is a backend, Amazon-like app where users can select, and "purchase" items where available in store.
Users recieve an order confirmation with item, quantity, and total costs of the items purchased.
If the number of requested item is not available, the user is notified the store is out of stock and given option to return to menu.
